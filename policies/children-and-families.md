title: Children and Families
---
Children are the next doctors, musicians, nurses, engineers, fire fighters and waiters, but only when each child has the same opportunities as the next. No child should be born into poverty and it's the job of the state to ensure equality of opportunity by supporting families and providing the support children need to make the most of life.

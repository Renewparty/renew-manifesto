## Social Media
*Ensuring children are taught the skills necessary to assess the information they receive and to challenge it in a constructive way
*Working with social media companies to end the use of anonymous social media accounts

## Homelessness

*Trialling a ‘housing first’ scheme, like Norway’s, which provides homes for the homeless. This will increase engagement in treatment services and create savings to utilise in other services.
*Committing to the eradication of street homelessness before 2030.

## Challenge Unfairness

*Supporting Women Against Pension Inequality (WASPI’s) campaign to review the current plans to change pension entitlement for women born in the 1950s.
*Boosting the Military Covenant because the selfless sacrifice the armed forces make for those they will never know is the epitome of duty and should be repaid accordingly.
*Ensuring those who design and administer public services demonstrate that they operate in a way that is respectful and compassionate.

title: Restoring Democracy
---


## Reform the system

*Changing the voting system, encouraging real competition between political parties, so that votes count in elections
*Potentially introducing compulsory voting with a minimal fine for abstention in an age of declining turnout, increasing representation in under-represented socio-economic groups and reducing political corruption
*Introducing processes to ensure a larger measure of formal policy deliberation outside the executive, improving pre-legislative scrutiny in parliament and a formal public consultation of organised interests and expert individuals

## Local power

*Allocating the power to take political decisions to the democratic level closest to where they will have their effect.
*This will require devolution of power from central government in the UK, to regions, cities and local councils, and with this devolution must also come the ability to raise more local taxes for local expenditure

## Transparency

*Creating new national standards for candidates across all parties, so that the public understand the process and so rebuild trust in our representatives
*Introducing mandatory DBS checks for all candidates, so that transparency is part of the process
*Creating consumer protection for political adverts and marketing, extending advertising and marketing standards to the political sphere
*Improving the systems that monitor and audit government delivery of its policies

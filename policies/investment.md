*Urgently reviewing the student loan system

## Life Long Learning

*Re-establishing the early childhood sure start programmes that provided the foundations for education

## Incentivise Responsibility

*Creating a Community Action Service programme, a citizen service for young people consisting of one year of social, community or military service for young adults. This will bring a wide range of benefits to the youth across the country and across social divides. Providing training and practical qualifications, improving communication, leadership and
teamwork skills and encouraging young people to experience life around the country 
*Seeking to engage our retired or retiring people through volunteering and potentially rewarding this service through credits that might be invested in and spent on activities

## Sustainable Solutions

*Investing in infrastructure and sustainable, renewable solutions to energy needs, developing investment in green technologies, for example through subsidies and tax incentives or by incorporating green technologies into new developments

## Tackle Pollution

*Supporting the implementation of a New Clean Air Act to help treat the epidemic of air pollution
*Reducing the many different types of pollution in the UK to encourage business to invest in creating clean jobs, and business and households to increase recycling
*Allowing delivery companies to reduce road tax liability by ensuring their vehicle fleets meet best-in-class emissions standards

## Carbon Reduction

*Ensuring that UK environmental regulations are equal to or stronger than existing EU regulations
*Recognising that nuclear energy has a lower carbon footprint, but being cautious about encouraging investment in major new nuclear power-generating facilities. New, potentially smaller, nuclear plants may mitigate some of these problems
*Embracing modern technology like electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles
